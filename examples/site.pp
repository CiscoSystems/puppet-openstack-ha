# This document serves as an example of how to deploy
# a multi-node openstack environment with high-availability.
# This deployment model uses nova-network for networking
# and nova-volume for block storage.

########### Proxy Configuration ##########
# If you use an HTTP/HTTPS proxy, uncomment this setting and specify the correct proxy URL.
# If you do not use an HTTP/HTTPS proxy, leave this setting commented out.
#$proxy             = "http://proxy-server:port-number"

# If you are behind a proxy you may choose not to use our ftp distribution, and
# instead try our http distribution location. Note the http location is not
# a permanent location and may change at any time.
$location          = "ftp://ftpeng.cisco.com/openstack/cisco"

# Alternate, uncomment this one, and coment out the one above
#$location           = "http://192.168.26.163/openstack/cisco"

########### NTP Configuration ############
# Change this to the location of a time server in your organization accessible to the build server
# The build server will synchronize with this time server, and will in turn function as the time
# server for your OpenStack nodes
$ntp_server = "ntp.example.com"

########### Build Node Cobbler Variables ############

# The cobbler node *must* have this IP configured and it *must* be on the same network as
# the hosts to install

# It doesn't have to be the name of your corporate DNS - a local DNS server on the build
# node will serve addresses in this domain - but if it is, you can also add entries for
# the nodes in your corporate DNS iand they will be usable *if* the above addresses 
# are routeable from elsewhere in your network.
